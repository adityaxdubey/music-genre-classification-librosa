# music-genre-classification-librosa
MLP implementation of music genre using GTZAN Dataset.
The model uses a dataset of audio features extracted from various music tracks, and it is trained to predict the genre of a given piece of music.
Librosa functions were used to capture fundamental audio characteristics, which were then utilized as inputs for the deep learning model.
